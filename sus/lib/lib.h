/// # The Subspace C++ Library
///
/// The Subspace C++ Library provides a concept-centered abstraction on top of
/// the bare-metal C++ standard library. It provides the tools to build
/// stable applications quickly, and to make your application performant through
/// explicitly leveraging compiler optimizations without tripping over Undefined
/// Behaviour. Stop spending time debugging tricky heisenbugs and start relying
/// on the compiler to produce the program you wrote.
