/// A concept for all implementations of iterators.
///
/// Types that satisfy this concept can be used in for loops and provide
/// all the methods of an iterator type, which are found in
/// `sus::iter::IteratorBase`.
///
/// Any Iterator's full definition includes a number of other methods as well,
/// built on top of next, and so you get them for free.
///
/// Iterators are also composable, and it's possible to chain them together to
/// do more complex forms of processing.
///
/// # Required methods.
///
/// An iterator has two required methods.
///
/// `next()`, which when called, returns an `Option<Item>`. Calling next will
/// return an `Option` containing the next `Item` as long as there are elements,
/// and once they've all been exhausted, will return `None` to indicate that
/// iteration is finished. Individual iterators may choose to resume iteration,
/// and so calling next again may or may not eventually start returning an
/// `Item` again at some point.
///
/// `size_hint()` that returns a `sus::iter::SizeHint` containing a lower bound
/// and optional upper bound on the number of elements left to be yielded by the
/// iterator. An upper bound of `None` indicates either an unknown upper bound
/// or a bound that is larger than `usize`. Rerturning `lower = 0` and `upper =
/// None` is correct for any iterator, but providing a more accurate bound can
/// benefit performance optiomizations. Returning an incorrect bound is
/// technically possible but is a violation of the Iterator protocol.

///
/// Something that implements `DoubleEndedIterator` has one extra capability
/// over something that implements `Iterator`: the ability to also take Items
/// from the back, as well as the front.
///
/// It is important to note that both back and forth work on the same range, and
/// do not cross: iteration is over when they meet in the middle.
///
/// In a similar fashion to the `Iterator` protocol, once a
/// `DoubleEndedIterator` returns `None` from a `next_back()`, calling it again
/// may or may not ever return `Some` again. `next()` and `next_back()` are
/// interchangeable for this purpose.

///
/// Many Iterators donâ€™t know how many times they will iterate, but some do. If
/// an iterator knows how many times it can iterate, providing access to that
/// information can be useful. For example, if you want to iterate backwards, a
/// good start is to know where the end is.
///
/// When implementing an `ExactSizeIterator`, you must also implement
/// `Iterator`.
///
/// Then, to implement `ExactSizeIterator`, provide the `exact_size_hint()`
/// method that returns the exact size of the iterator. The implementation of
/// `Iterator::size_hint()` must also return the exact size of the iterator
/// (usually by calling `exact_size_hint()`).
