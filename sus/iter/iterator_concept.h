/// A concept for all implementations of iterators.
/// See [`IteratorBase`]($sus::iter::IteratorBase) for the methods on an
/// `Iterator`.
///
/// Types that satisfy this concept can be used in for loops and provide
/// all the methods of an iterator type, which are found in
/// [`IteratorBase`]($sus::iter::IteratorBase).
///
/// Any `Iterator`'s full definition includes a number of other methods as well,
/// built on top of next, and so you get them for free.
///
/// Iterators are also composable, and it's possible to chain them together to
/// do more complex forms of processing.
///
/// # Required methods.
///
/// An iterator has two required methods.
///
/// * `auto next() -> `[`Option`]($sus::option::Option)`<Item>`
/// 
///   Returns an [`Option`]($sus::option::Option)
///   containing the next `Item` as long as there are elements,
///   and once they've all been exhausted, will return `None` to indicate that
///   iteration is finished. Individual iterators may choose to resume
///   iteration, and so calling next again may or may not eventually start
///   returning an `Item` again at some point.
///
/// * `auto size_hint() const -> `[`SizeHint`]($sus::iter::SizeHint)
/// 
///   Returns a [`SizeHint`]($sus::iter::SizeHint) containing a lower bound
///   and optional upper bound on the number of elements left to be yielded by
///   the iterator. An upper bound of `None` indicates either an unknown upper
///   bound or a bound that is larger than `usize`. Returning `lower = 0` and
///   `upper = None` is correct for any iterator, but providing a more accurate
///   bound can benefit performance optiomizations. Returning an incorrect bound
///   is technically possible but is a violation of the `Iterator` protocol.

/// # Implementing TrustedLen
/// To opt into implementing `TrustedLen` a `trusted_len() const` method should
/// return the `TrustedLenMarker` type.

/// # When shouldn't an adapter be TrustedLen?
/// If an adapter makes an iterator shorter by a given amount, then it's usually
/// incorrect for that adapter to implement `TrustedLen`. The inner iterator
/// might return more than [`usize::MAX`]($sus::num::usize::MAX) items, but
/// there's no way to know what `k` elements less than that will be, since the
/// `size_hint` from the inner iterator has already saturated and lost that
/// information.

/// when `I` implements `TrustedLen`.

/// This trait must only be implemented when the contract is upheld. Consumers
/// of this trait must inspect `Iterator::size_hint()`'s upper bound.
