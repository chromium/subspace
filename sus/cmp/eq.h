/// Concept for types that can be compared for equality with the `==` and `!=`
/// operators. There is no guarantee of a full equivalence relation, and a
/// partial equivalence is possible, which allows for values that compare
/// not-equal to themselves (such as NaN).
///
/// Implementations must ensure that `operator==` and `operator!=` are
/// consistent with each other:
///
/// * `a != b` if and only if `!(a == b)`.
///
/// The default implementation of `operator!=` provides this consistency
/// and is almost always sufficient. It should not be overridden without very
/// good reason.
///
/// This maps to the [`PartialEq`](
/// https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html) trait in Rust
/// rather than the `Eq` trait. Since C++ does not understand
/// equivalent vs partial equivalence, we are unable to differentiate and
/// provide a stronger relationship than partial equivalence.
