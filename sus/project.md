# The Subspace C++ Library

The Subspace C++ Library provides a concept-centered abstraction on top of
the bare-metal C++ standard library. It provides the tools to build
stable applications quickly, and to make your application performant through
explicitly leveraging compiler optimizations without tripping over Undefined
Behaviour. Stop spending time debugging tricky heisenbugs and start relying
on the compiler to produce the program you wrote.
