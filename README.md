# Subspace Library

An experimental take on a safer, simpler C++ standard library.

Please don't use this library. This is an experiment and we don't yet know where
it will take us. There will be breaking changes without warning, and there is no
stable version.

# Getting started

1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)
1. Install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. `cmake -B out`
1. `cmake --build out`
1. `ctest --test-dir out`

## Clang format

The latest LLVM release does not have sufficient C++20 support to format the
library correctly. To get a more bleeding edge clang-format executable, we get
it from the Chromium project:

1. Install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or from the Windows
   Store) and add it to your path.
1. Download
   [depot_tools](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up),
   extract it, and put it in your path.
1. Run `gclient` in a terminal to set it up.
1. Make a directory to hold the clang-format binary.
1. Download the [sha1
   file](https://source.chromium.org/search?q=clang-format.*%5C.sha1&sq=&ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc:buildtools%2F)
   for your platform and put it in that directory.
1. From in that same directory, in a terminal, run download_from_google_storage
   to pull down the clang-format binary.
    * On Windows: `python ..\depot_tools\download_from_google_storage.py --no_resume --no_auth --bucket chromium-clang-format -s clang-format.exe.sha1`
    * Elsewhere: `python ..\depot_tools\download_from_google_storage.py
     --no_resume --no_auth --bucket chromium-clang-format -s clang-format.sha1`
    * The command comes [from here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:DEPS;l=3922-3930;drc=ea057e49017041bc61fb7dee82d08a4ca8078565).
1. Point your IDE to the downloaded clang-format executable.

## For Windows/VSCode.

1. Install Visual Studio 2022. Don't bother installing the CMake tools from it, they don't work as well
1. Set the "Windows SDK Version" in VSCode to `10.0.19041.0` (or the version installed with Visual Studio)
1. Set the "CMake: Generator" in VSCode to `Visual Studio 17 2022`, or add it to "CMake: Preferred Generators"

# Building CIR

CIR is a midlevel representaion of C++ built on Clang in the spirit of [Rust's
MIR](https://kanishkarj.github.io/rust-internals-mir).

CIR requires an installation of LLVM from Git HEAD, including the LLVM/Clang headers and libraries.

By default it looks for llvm in `../llvm/build/install`, but you can change this
by setting the `LLVM_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable.

To build LLVM from VSCode, the following can be put in `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
    "cmake.configureOnOpen": false,
    "cmake.sourceDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/llvm",
    "cmake.buildDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/build/${buildType}/${variant:platform}",
    "cmake.installPrefix": "${workspaceFolder}/build/install",
    "cmake.generator": "Ninja",
    "cmake.configureArgs": [
        "-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang",
    ],
    "C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools"
}
```
Then use VSCode to choose a build configuration and run the "CMake: Build" and
"CMake: Install" tasks.
