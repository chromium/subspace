# Subspace Library

An [experimental take](https://danakj.github.io/2022/12/31/why-subspace.html)
on a safer, simpler C++ standard library.

Please don't use this library. This is an experiment and we don't yet know where
it will take us. There will be breaking changes without warning, and there is no
stable version.

## Getting started

1. Install [depot_tools](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up)
1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)
1. Install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. `gclient sync --jobs=16`
1. `cmake -B out`
1. `cmake --build out`
1. `ctest --test-dir out`

## CMake options
The CMake files define the following options:

* `SUBSPACE_BUILD_CIR`, defaults to `ON`, set to `OFF` to disable CIR build

## Clang format

The latest LLVM release does not have sufficient C++20 support to format the
library correctly. To get a more bleeding edge clang-format executable, we get
it from the Chromium project. The binary is downloaded by gclient and
resides in `third_party/buildtools/<platform>/clang-format`. Point your IDE at that
executable.

## For Windows/VSCode.

1. Install Visual Studio 2022. Don't bother installing the CMake tools from it, they don't work as well
1. Set the "Windows SDK Version" in VSCode to `10.0.19041.0` (or the version installed with Visual Studio)
1. Set the "CMake: Generator" in VSCode to `Visual Studio 17 2022`, or add it to "CMake: Preferred Generators"

# Building CIR

CIR is a mid-level representation of C++ built on Clang in the spirit of [Rust's
MIR](https://kanishkarj.github.io/rust-internals-mir).

CIR requires an installation of LLVM from Git HEAD, including the LLVM/Clang
headers and libraries.

By default, in VSCode it looks for LLVM and clang in the following places, from
Subspace's `.vscode/settings.json`, but you will need to set these environment
variables if building in another way.
```json
"cmake.environment": {
    "LLVM_DIR": "../../llvm/build/install/lib/cmake/llvm",
    "Clang_DIR": "../../llvm/build/install/lib/cmake/clang",
},
```

To build LLVM from VSCode, the following can be put in LLVM's
`.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
    "cmake.configureOnOpen": false,
    "cmake.sourceDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/llvm",
    "cmake.buildDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/build/${buildType}/${variant:platform}",
    "cmake.installPrefix": "${workspaceFolder}/build/install",
    "cmake.generator": "Ninja",
    "cmake.configureArgs": [
        "-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang",
    ],
    "C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools"
}
```
Then use VSCode to choose a build configuration and run the "CMake: Build" and
"CMake: Install" tasks.

## Windows

On windows, set the environment variable `LLVM_DEBUG=1` if the LLVM build was a
debug build in order for CIR to link the appropriate runtime.
