/// A `Copy` type can be copied to construct a new object and can assigned to by
/// copy.
///
/// Satisfying `Copy` also implies that the type satisfies `Clone`.
///
/// Const (non-reference) types are not `Copy` as they can't be assigned to.
/// References are always `Copy`, even if const, as a reference can always be
/// constructed from a reference.
///
/// Typically types should only be `Copy` when performing a copy is very cheap,
/// and thus unlikely to cause performance problems. For types that are larger
/// or more complex to copy, it is better to make them satisfy `Clone` instead
/// so that copies are always explicit.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// struct S {
///   S() = default;
///   S(const S&) = default;
///   S& operator=(const S&) = default;
/// };
/// static_assert(sus::mem::Copy<S>);
/// static_assert(sus::mem::Clone<S>);
/// ```
