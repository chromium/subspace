/// A `Move` type can be moved-from to construct a new object and can be

/// A type satisfies `Move` by implementing a move constructor and assignment
/// operator.
///
/// A type that is `Copy` is also `Move`. However the type can opt out by
/// explicitly deleteing the move constructor and assignment operator. This is
/// not recommended, unless deleting the copy operations too, as it tends to
/// break things that want to move-or-fallback-to-copy.
///
/// As a special case, types that can not be assigned to at all, by copy or
/// move, can still satisfy Move by being able to construct by move. This is
/// requires for types like lambdas.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// struct S {
///   S() = default;
///   S(S&&) = default;
///   S& operator=(S&&) = default;
/// };
/// static_assert(sus::mem::Move<S>);

///
/// `move()` requires that `t` can be moved from, so it requires that `t` is

/// The `move()` call itself does nothing to `t`, as it is just a cast, similar
/// to `std::move()`. It enables an lvalue (a named object) to be used as an
/// rvalue.
